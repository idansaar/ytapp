# YTApp - iOS YouTube Video Player

## Overview
YTApp is a streamlined iOS application designed for seamless YouTube video consumption with enhanced user experience features. The app provides instant paste-and-play functionality, background playback capabilities, and intelligent video organization through history, channel subscriptions, and favorites management.

## Phase 1 - Foundation (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

### Features Implemented
- **Paste & Play Functionality**: Instant detection and playback of YouTube URLs from clipboard
- **Basic Video Playback**: Full-screen AVKit-based video player with standard controls
- **History Tracking**: Automatic saving of watched videos with metadata
- **History Management**: View, replay, and delete previously watched videos
- **Clean SwiftUI Interface**: Native iOS design patterns with intuitive navigation
- **Simple Data Persistence**: In-memory storage for video history during app sessions

### Technical Architecture
- **SwiftUI + AVKit**: Modern iOS development stack
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clear separation of concerns with reactive updates
- **Real-time Clipboard Monitoring**: 1-second polling for YouTube URL detection
- **Regex-based URL Parsing**: Support for multiple YouTube URL formats
- **iOS 14+ Compatibility**: Backward compatibility without newer iOS dependencies

### Build Requirements
- **Xcode**: 15.0 or later
- **iOS Deployment Target**: 14.0+
- **Swift**: 5.0+
- **Frameworks**: SwiftUI, AVKit, UIKit, Foundation

### Testing Instructions
1. Copy a YouTube URL to clipboard (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
2. Open YTApp - "Play from Clipboard" button should appear automatically
3. Tap button to launch full-screen video player
4. Use "View History" to see previously watched videos
5. Swipe left on history items to delete

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 2: Enhanced Playback (PLANNED)
- Picture-in-Picture (PiP) implementation
- Background playback support
- Real Core Data integration
- Thumbnail image loading and caching
- Enhanced video player controls

### Phase 3: Multi-Tab Interface (PLANNED)
- Tab-based navigation system
- Favorites management with swipe actions
- Enhanced history functionality
- Swipe-to-favorite from history

### Phase 4: Channel Management (PLANNED)
- YouTube channel subscription system
- Configurable video lookback periods
- Watch status tracking and visual indicators
- Channel video listings with management

### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization (PLANNED)
- Performance optimizations and memory management
- Advanced settings and user preferences
- Background refresh for channel updates
- Comprehensive error handling and edge cases

## Current Limitations (Phase 1)
- **Video Streaming**: Uses embed URLs (production requires youtube-dl integration)
- **Thumbnails**: Placeholder rectangles (real thumbnails in Phase 2)
- **Persistence**: In-memory only (Core Data integration in Phase 2)
- **Single Interface**: Multi-tab navigation planned for Phase 3
